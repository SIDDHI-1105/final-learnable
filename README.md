🌱 Future Scope

We are just getting started, and the future of Resource Finder is focused on creating an engaging, inclusive, and gamified learning experience.

Gamified Learning Experience
We plan to redesign the platform with a gamified theme to make learning fun and interactive. For example:

* After completing each lesson, learners will unlock flashcards and mini-games.
* Imagine a Mario-style game: if the answer is correct, Mario jumps forward. If it's wrong, he falls.
  This approach is designed to boost retention and overall engagement.

Career Path Switching
We recognize that many learners explore different interests over time. Our roadmap includes a "Career Switch" module, allowing users to consider a new career path after every lesson, based on their performance and interest.

Support for Non-Technical Backgrounds
We are also building features for learners from non-technical fields:

* Psychology students can play interactive games like Mortal Mystery, where they apply concepts through storytelling and decision-making.
* Creative modules will be available for students in arts, humanities, business, and other fields, making theoretical learning more hands-on and accessible.

Hackathons for All
We aim to build a diverse learning community. Our upcoming hackathons and challenges will welcome not only coders but also writers, designers, psychology students, and problem-solvers from every domain. Whether you enjoy coding or tackling real-world challenges, you will have a space to participate and grow.
